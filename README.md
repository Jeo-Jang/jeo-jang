### Hi there, I'm Jeongwoo 👋
**GenAI Architect & Automation Engineer** based in Hamburg, Germany 🇩🇪

> *"I used to architect buildings. Now, I architect intelligent systems."*

I started my career in Architecture (M.Sc.), designing physical spaces. At **INDEED Innovation**, my role evolved from **Computational Design** to **GenAI Architecture** as I built the company's internal AI Hub from scratch. Today, I specialize in **Agentic Systems** that turn chaotic workflows into structured automation.

### 🚀 Featured Architecture: Internal GenAI Toolbox
I architected and maintain a GDPR-compliant GenAI platform for teams of designers, engineers, and strategists. This repository showcases the **Hub-and-Spoke architecture** and **Guardrail patterns** currently used in production.

> **[🛡️ View the System Architecture](https://github.com/Jeo-Jang/projects/tree/main/indeed-ai-toolbox-architecture)**
>
> * **The Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Azure OpenAI, Supabase, Docker.
> * **The Logic:** Centralized Auth Gate with isolated "Spoke" modules.
> * **The Compliance:** Data sovereignty enforced via data residency in **Germany West Central**.
> * **The Data:** Stateless processing for sensitive documents.
> * **The Agents:** Specialized Pydantic-guarded agents for **ISO Standards** & **Packaging**.
