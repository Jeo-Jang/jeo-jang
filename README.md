### Hi there, I'm Jeongwoo 👋
**AI Solutions Architect** based in Hamburg, Germany 🇩🇪

> *"I used to architect buildings. Now, I architect intelligent systems."*

I started my career in Architecture (M.Sc.), designing physical spaces. Today, I serve as an **AI Solutions Architect**, bridging the gap between creative workflows and engineering rigor. I specialize in building secure **Enterprise GenAI Hubs**, **RAG Pipelines**, and **Agentic Systems** that turn chaotic data into structured intelligence.

### 🚀 Featured Architecture: Enterprise GenAI Hub
I architected the internal GenAI infrastructure for **INDEED Innovation**, moving from a prototype to a secure, GDPR-compliant platform serving 20+ tools.

> **[🛡️ View the System Architecture](https://github.com/Jeo-Jang/Portfolio/blob/main/gen-ai-hub/architecture.md)**
>
> * **The Architecture:** Scalable **Hub-and-Spoke** pattern decoupling tool logic from core orchestration.
> * **The Security:** **Microsoft Entra ID (SSO)** and **Row-Level Security (RLS)** via Supabase.
> * **The Knowledge:** **Vector Database (pgvector)** integration for RAG retrieval.
> * **The Agents:** ISO-compliant agents guarded by **Pydantic** and **OpenAI SDK**.
